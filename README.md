In order to use the program ensure that pymem and pyautogui are installed. Secondly, the code automatically tries to move the cursor of the computer it is running on, to see a full setup of how to try to setup the screen so that the code would work please see the demo video. It is possible to disable the automoving for testing purposes by adding an extra command line arguement when running the code. super_decode.py is the correct program to run, decode.py is outdated but is still included for legacy purposes.
